## 📚 Theory  

In SQL, **TCL** stands for **Transaction Control Language**.  

- A transaction is a single unit of work in a database, formed after the consecutive execution of commands.  
- TCL commands help the user manage the transactions that take place in a database.  
- Commonly used TCL commands:  
  - **COMMIT** – Saves all the changes permanently to the database.  
  - **ROLLBACK** – Undoes the changes made in the current transaction.  
  - **SAVEPOINT** – Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
