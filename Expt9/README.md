# Experiment â€“ Implementation of Set Operators, Nested Queries and Join Queries  

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim  
To implement set operators, nested queries and join queries in SQL.  

---

## ðŸ“š Theory  

### SET Operators  
SET operators are special types of operators which are used to combine the result of two queries. Operators covered under SET operators are:  

- **UNION**  
- **UNION ALL**  
- **INTERSECT**  
- **MINUS**  

---

### Nested Queries (Subqueries)  
A **Subquery** (or Inner query / Nested query) is a query within another SQL query and embedded within the `WHERE` clause.  

- A subquery is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data retrieved.  
- Subqueries can be used with the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.  
- Common operators: `=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, etc.

### JOIN Queries  
A **JOIN** clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
