# AIM

To create views and assertions.

# THEORY

## Views in SQL

- Views in SQL are considered as a **virtual table**.  
- A view also contains **rows and columns**.  
- To create a view, we can select the fields from **one or more tables** present in the database.  
- A view can either have **specific rows based on certain conditions** or **all the rows of a table**.  

## Assertions in SQL

- An **assertion** is a statement in SQL that ensures a **certain condition will always exist** in the database.  
- Assertions are similar to **column and table constraints**, except they are specified **separately from table definitions**.

# QUESTIONS & OUTPUTS
